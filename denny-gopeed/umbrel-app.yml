  ðŸ“¥ Gopeed is an open-source, cross-platform download manager designed for high performance and flexibility. Built using Golang and Flutter, it leverages Goroutines to enable multi-threaded downloading, which boosts speed and efficiency. It supports a wide range of protocols, including HTTP, BitTorrent, and Magnet links, making it versatile for different types of downloads.


  The application features a clean, modern user interface based on Material Design principles, ensuring an intuitive user experience. Itâ€™s available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and even as a web-based version and a command-line tool. This broad availability allows users to manage downloads seamlessly across devices.


  Gopeed also supports browser extensions for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, enabling users to initiate downloads directly from web pages. Additionally, the software provides an API for integration with other tools and services, allowing advanced customization and automation possibilities.


  Its lightweight nature and extendability make it suitable for both casual users and power users who need more control over their downloads. The project is actively maintained on GitHub, inviting contributions and ensuring ongoing improvements.
